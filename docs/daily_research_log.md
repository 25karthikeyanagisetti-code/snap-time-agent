- Hypothesis: Encoding only high-magnitude emotional outcomes (gate on max(final_emotion)) prevents the Homogenization Collapse at κ=1.0.
- Result: failed — magnitude-gating produces a U-shaped homogenization: too little encoding floods the store, too much lets the seeded prior dominate; rescue rate at ep9 stays ≤15% across all τ.
- Headline number: max divergence@ep9 = 11.5 pts at τ=0.3 (vs 0.8 pts baseline; 0 pts at τ≥0.5).
